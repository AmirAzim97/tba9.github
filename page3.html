</strong><div><strong>
</strong></div><div>In many ways, mental health is just like physical health: everybody has it and we need to take care of it.
</div><div>Good mental health means being generally able to think, feel and react in the ways that you need and want to live your life. But if you go through a period of poor mental health you might find the ways you’re frequently thinking, feeling or reacting become difficult, or even impossible, to cope with. This can feel just as bad as a physical illness, or even worse.
</div><div>You might be given a diagnosis of a particular type of mental health problem. Or you might not have any particular diagnosis, but still be finding things very difficult. Everyone’s experience is different and can change at different times.
</div><div>However, in reality, mental health problems are a common human experience. Most people know someone who has experienced a mental health problem, they affect around one in four people in any given year. They can happen to all kinds of people from all walks of life. And it’s likely that, when you find a combination of self-care, treatment and support that works for you, you will get better.</div></div>

                    <li><strong>(2) What types of mental health problem are there?</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Depression
 -&nbsp;</strong>Depression is a feeling of low mood that lasts for a long time and affects your everyday life. It can make you feel hopeless, despairing, guilty, worthless, unmotivated and exhausted. It can affect your  self-esteem, sleep, appetite, sex drive and your physical health.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Anxiety
 -&nbsp;</strong>Anxiety is what we feel when we are worried, tense or afraid – particularly about things that are about to happen, or which we think could happen in the future.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Obsessive compulsive disorder
 -&nbsp;</strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a type of anxiety disorder. The term  is often misused in daily conversation – for example, you might hear people talk about being ‘a bit OCD’, if they like things to be neat and tidy. But the reality of this disorder is a lot more complex and serious.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Eating disorder
 -&nbsp;</strong>Eating problems are not just about food. They can be about difficult and painful feelings which you may be finding hard to face or resolve. Lots of people think that if you have an eating problem you will be over- or underweight&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Phobias
 -&nbsp;</strong>A phobia is an extreme form of fear or anxiety triggered by a particular situation (such as going outside) or object (such as spiders), even when it’s very unlikely to be dangerous. A fear becomes a phobia if the fear  is out of proportion to the danger, it lasts for more than six months,  and has a significant impact on how you live your day-to-day life.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Bi-polar disorders
 -&nbsp;</strong>Bipolar disorder (once called manic depression) mainly affects  your mood. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Schizophrenia
 -&nbsp;</strong>Views on schizophrenia have changed over the years. Lots of people question whether it’s really a distinct condition, or actually a few different conditions that overlap. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Personality disorder
 -&nbsp;</strong>Personality disorder is a type of mental health problem where your attitudes, beliefs and behaviours cause you longstanding problems  in your life. If you have this diagnosis it doesn’t mean that you’re fundamentally different from other people.&nbsp;</li>

</strong></p><p>Panic attacks are a type of fear response. They’re an exaggeration  of your body’s normal response to danger, stress or excitement.
</p><p>During a panic attack physical symptoms can build up very quickly, including:
</p><p>• a pounding heartbeat or chest pains.
</p><p>• sweating and nausea (feeling sick). 
</p><p>• feeling faint and unable to breathe.
</p><p>• shaky limbs, or feeling like your legs are turning to jelly.
</p><p>• feeling as if you aren’t connected to your body.
</p><p><br></p><p><strong>(2) Self-harm 
</strong></p><p>Self-harm is when you hurt yourself as a way of dealing with very difficult feelings, painful memories or overwhelming situations and experiences. You may not know why you self-harm, but it can be a means of expressing feelings that you can’t put into words or think clearly about.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">After self-harming you may feel a short-term sense of release, but the cause of your distress is unlikely to have gone away. Self-harm can also bring up very difficult emotions and could make you feel worse.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
</p><p><strong>(3) Psychosis</strong> 
</p><p>Psychosis (also called a psychotic experience or psychotic episode)  is when you perceive or interpret reality in a very different way from people around you. The most common types of psychosis are:
</p><p>&nbsp;• hallucinations, such as hearing voices or having visions.
</p><p>&nbsp;• delusions, such as paranoia.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>(4) Suicidal feelings 
</strong></p><p>Many people experience suicidal thoughts and feelings at some point  in their lifetime. They can be very unpleasant, intrusive and frightening, but having thoughts about suicide doesn’t necessarily mean that you intend to act on them. Most people don’t go on to attempt to take their own lives.

</p><p>• Experiencing discrimination and stigma

</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Research suggests that some mental health problems may run in families. For example, if you have a parent with schizophrenia, you are more likely to develop schizophrenia yourself. But no one knows  if this is because of our genes or because of other factors, such as  the environment we grow up in, or the ways of thinking, coping and behaving that we may learn from our parents.
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">Although the development of some mental health problems may be influenced by our genes, researchers haven’t found any specific genes that definitely cause mental health problems. And many people who experience a mental health problem don’t have any parents, children  or other relatives with the same condition.&nbsp;</span></blockquote>

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>(4) What can I do to help myself cope?</strong><br><br><div><strong>
(1)</strong> <strong>Stay aware of your metal health</strong></div><div>• Tell people what helps.
</div><div>&nbsp;If certain treatments have helped in the past, tell your doctor. Let your friends and family know how they can support you.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;• Spot your early warning signs.
</div><div>&nbsp;Try to be aware of how you’re feeling and watch out for any signs you might be becoming unwell, so you can get support as soon as possible.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;• Keep a mood diary.
</div><div>&nbsp;Tracking your moods can help you to work out what makes you feel better or worse. You can then take steps to avoid, change or prepare for difficult situations. You can create your own mood diary or find one online.
</div><br><div><em><strong>(2) Nourish your social life Feeling connected to other people is important.</strong></em> 
</div><div>It can help you  to feel valued and confident about yourself, and can give you a different perspective on things. If you can, try to spend some time connecting with friends and family – even a text or phone call can  make a difference.
</div><div>If you don’t have supportive friends and family around you and are feeling isolated, there are other ways you can make connections.  For example, you could try going to community events where you  might have some interests or experiences in common with other  people there, or joining a group like a local book club or sports team.
</div><div>
</div><div><em><strong>(3) Try peer support.
</strong></em></div><div>When you experience a mental health problem it can feel like no one understands. Peer support brings together people who’ve had similar experiences to support each other. 
</div><div>
</div><div>This can offer many benefits, such as:
</div><div>&nbsp;• feeling accepted for who you are
</div><div>&nbsp;• increased self-confidence 
</div><div>• meeting new people and using your experiences to help others 
</div><div>• finding out new information and places for support 
</div><div>• challenging stigma and discrimination.
</div><br><div><em><strong>(4) Make time for therapeutic activities 
</strong></em></div><div>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">There are various techniques and therapies you can safely practice  on your own. For example:&nbsp;</span></div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;• Relaxation – you may already know what helps you relax, like having a bath, listening to music or taking your dog for a walk.  If you know that a certain activity helps you feel more relaxed, make sure you set aside time to do it. 
</div><div>&nbsp;• Mindfulness – mindfulness is a therapeutic technique that involves being more aware of the present moment. Practicing mindfulness can help you become more aware of your own moods and reactions, but not everyone finds it helpful. 
</div><div>&nbsp;• Getting into nature – getting out into a green environment, such  as a park or the countryside, is especially good for you. Even if  you don’t have a garden or aren’t very mobile, caring for plants  or animals indoors can still help you get some benefits from nature. 
</div><div>
</div><div>
<em><strong>(5) Contact a specialist organization&nbsp;</strong></em></div><div>&nbsp;If you have a particular mental health diagnosis, or would like help  in a specific aspect of your life, there may be specialist charities and organizations out there who can offer support. 
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>
(6)</strong> <strong>Look after your physical health</strong></div><div>Taking steps to look after your physical health can help you manage your mental health too: 
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;• Get enough sleep. 
</div><div>Rest when you can. This can help you have  the energy to cope with difficult feelings and experiences.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;• Avoid recreational drugs and alcohol. 
</div><div>While you might want to use recreational drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult feelings, in the long run they can make you feel a lot worse.
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>&nbsp;• Make time for personal care.
</div><div>&nbsp;When you’re experiencing a mental health problem, it’s easy for personal care to not feel like a priority. But small everyday things, such as taking a shower and getting fully dressed, can make a big difference to how you feel.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;• Eat healthily. 
</div><div>What you eat, and when you eat, can make a big difference to how well you feel.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;• Keep physically active. 
</div><div>Regular exercise doesn’t have to be very strenuous or sporty to be effective – to start with you could try gentle exercise like going for a short walk, yoga or swimming.  The important thing is to pick something you enjoy doing, so  you’re more likely to stick with it.

</p><div>
</div><div>• What you’re experiencing (groupings of certain feelings, behaviors and physical symptoms may suggest different diagnoses). 
</div><div>• How long you’ve been experiencing these things. 
</div><div>• The impact it’s having on your life.
</div><div>To do this they may ask you questions about your mood, thoughts and behaviours – sometimes by using questionnaires or forms. They will base your diagnosis on what you describe. 
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Who can diagnose me?
</strong></div><div>&nbsp;For common problems such as depression and anxiety, your GP may  be able to give you a diagnosis after one or two appointments. For  less common problems you’ll need to be referred to a mental health specialist (such as a psychiatrist), and they may want to see you over  a longer period of time before making a diagnosis.
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>What if I don’t find my diagnosis helpful? 
</strong></div><div>Receiving a diagnosis can be a positive experience. You might feel relieved that you can put a name to what’s wrong, and it can help you and your doctor discuss what kind of treatment might work best for you.
</div><div>
</div><div>However, a lot of people, including some doctors and psychiatrists,  feel the medical model of diagnosis and treatment is not enough.  For example, you might feel that the diagnosis you’re given doesn’t  fully fit your experiences, or that it’s simplistic and puts you in a box. Other factors – such as your background, lifestyle and other personal circumstances – may be just as important in understanding what  you’re experiencing and working out how best to help you feel better.
</div><div>
</div><div>A diagnosis does not have to shape your entire life, and may come  to be a relatively minor part of your identity
