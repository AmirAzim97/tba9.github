            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-white mbr-fonts-style display-5">Tips to Improve Your Physical Health<br><br><div>1. Walk</div><div>It may seem simple, but walking can help you burn a lot of calories in a short amount of time. In fact, a person who weights 160 pounds can burn over 90 calories in about 30 minutes going at a slow pace. And there are many, other daily activities you do regularly that can help you burn calories like laundry, gardening, cleaning, brushing your teeth, and more! You may find that your favorite hobby is actually a good workout.
</div><div><br></div><div>2.	Exercise from a Chair
</div><div>If you are confined to a chair or stuck sitting at work all day, check out these exercises from Forbes.com. My favourite webs is the “Wooden Leg.” You just raise one leg in front of you, hold it for a couple of seconds and then put it down. Repeat alternating your legs, and you can increase the strength of your lower body without leaving your desk.
</div><div><br></div><div>3.	Just Breathe
</div><div>Instead of just focusing on your physical activities, it’s important to slow down a bit as well. Take some time for yourself. Find a quiet place where you can lie down and relax. You can meditate or simply listen to the sounds around you. Breathe slowly and deeply and let go of your cares with each exhale. When you finish, you’ll be calmer and ready to take on your next challenge.
</div><div><br></div><div>4.	Stretch
</div><div>After you are done with your quiet time, you may want to do some light stretching. It will help your body avoid injury and improve recovery and flexibility. One of my favorite stretches is really simple. Bring your shoulders up to your ears as high as you can and hold for about 10 seconds and crinkle your face up too. Then, let everything go and repeat. You won’t believe how much stress is lurking in your shoulders and face! (And a brief warning; you may want to make sure you are alone for this this stretching activity). Otherwise, it could be caught on camera and show up on social media.
</div><div>
</div><div>5.	Use your own body
</div><div>If you avoid exercising because you don’t have the appropriate equipment or a gym membership, you can get rid of that excuse right now! There are some fantastic ways to use your own body as part of a resistance-training programme. For example, in addition to standard push-ups and sit-ups, try a plank or the “Superman or Superwoman.” To help strengthen your lower back, here, you simple lie on the ground facing down, and slowly lift your arms, legs and head up, hold for five seconds, let go, and repeat.

</h2>
                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5"><div><strong>1. Get treatment from a doctor
</strong></div><div>When we find that someone has signs of mental illness, get medical treatment immediately. Do not let it drag on, worry about getting protracted and to the point of endangering suicide.
</div><div><strong>2. Keep your body healthy
</strong></div><div>Fulfill the rights to the body. Keep nutrition by eating nutritious and timely food. Make sure the sport becomes weekly routine. Becoming a smart and mindful one is a demand in Islam to avoid any illness.
</div><div><strong>3. Keep spiritual
</strong></div><div>As one eats to feed the stomach, so is our internal need for food to meet internal requirements. The Word of Allah: "O Believers, ask for help (with Allah) with patience and prayer" (al-Baqarah : verse 153). This verse clearly explains when a person is in trouble, be patient in facing him and pray.
</div><div><strong>4. Hang with people
</strong></div><div>Humans need each other. The Prophet himself emphasized the silaturrahim of a fellow Muslim. Avoid staying alone because it will lead to a sense of humor and love. That attitude is very dangerous, because without knowing it is eating. Discuss the problem with people we trust and a little bit of relief.
